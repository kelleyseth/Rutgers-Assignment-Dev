 * Steps to implement this class main method:
 * 
 * Step 1:
 * DimensionInputFile name is passed through the command line as args[0]
 * Read from the DimensionsInputFile with the format:
 * 1. The first line with three numbers:
 *      i.    a (int): number of dimensions in the graph
 *      ii.   b (int): the initial size of the cluster table prior to rehashing
 *      iii.  c (double): the capacity(threshold) used to rehash the cluster table 
 * 
 * Step 2:
 * ClusterOutputFile name is passed in through the command line as args[1]
 * Output to ClusterOutputFile with the format:
 * 1. n lines, listing all of the dimension numbers connected to 
 *    that dimension in order (space separated)
 *    n is the size of the cluster table.
